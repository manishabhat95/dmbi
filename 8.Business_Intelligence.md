**1. Consider the following the case study**

An International chain of hotels wants to analyze and improve its performance using sevaral performance indicators quality of room, service facility, check in, break-fast , popular time of visit, duration of stay, etc.

For this case study design a BI system. Clearly explain all the steps from data collection to decision making.

• Information delivery is the core of Business Intelligence apart from, analysis to discover new insights and integration to implement these insights.

There are three major issues in Business Intelligence:

• Data mining methodology:

 Mining different kinds of knowledge from diverse data types.

 Performance: efficiency, effectiveness and scalability.

 Pattern evaluation: The interestingness pattern.

 Incorporation of background pattern.

 Handling noise and incomplete data.

 Parallel, distributed and incremental mining methods.

 Integration of the discovered knowledge with existing one : Knowledge fusion.

• User interaction:

o Data mining query languages and ad-hoc mining.

o Expression and visualization of resultant knowledge.

o Interactive mining of knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction.

• Applications and social impact:

o Domain specific data mining and invisible data mining.

o Protection of data security, integrity and privacy.
